# 🍅 TomaDo – Task Manager + Pomodoro App

**TomaDo** is a full-stack productivity app.

## 👨‍💼 Built for **Airrick Dunfield**

---

It blends a drag-and-drop task board with a Pomodoro timer, letting users organize tasks, manage images, and focus through cycles.

---

## ✨ Features

- Drag and drop tasks across columns (Not Started, In Progress, Done)
- Add, edit, and delete tasks with optional image and category
- Upload + preview images (with delete option)
- Filter tasks by custom emoji-supported categories
- Pomodoro timer with automatic cycles and sound cues
- "Done" tasks appear with strike-through for clarity
- Interactive front-end built with React

---

## ⏱️ Pomodoro Logic

- 25 minutes of focus → 5-minute short break
- After 4 focus sessions → 15-minute long break
- Automatic transitions with unique sounds for each stage
- Timer resets after completing one full Pomodoro cycle
- Timer runs alongside the task board without interruptions
